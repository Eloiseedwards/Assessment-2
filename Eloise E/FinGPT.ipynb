        "FinGPT is an end-to-end open-source framework for financial LLMS (FinLLMs). It consists of five components:\n",
        "* Data Source - This layer combines a variety of data sources to form comprehensive market coverage.\n",
        "* Data Engineering - This layer focuses on real time processing for text based financial data. This includes data cleaning, tokenization, vector embedded and other similar techniques.\n",
        "* LLMs - This layer allows lightweight adaptations and methodologies to be used to keep LLMs up to date.\n",
        "* Tasks - This layer is used as a building block in order to create specific FinLLMs with a given base LLM. It allows these base LLMs to be fine tuned for financial landscapes and establishes a set of standardised metrics.\n",
        "* Applications - This layer allows us to see the practicality of having dynamic open-source FinLLMs.\n",
        "\n",
        "In short, FinGPT provides a platform to create and use fine-tuned FinLLMs in a more accessible way.\n",
        "\n",
        "With respect to this project, pre-trained FinGPT sentiment analysis models from hugging face can be used to create a new fine-tuned model based on our financial dataset. There are two such model available: FinGPT/fingpt-sentiment_llama2-13b_lora and FinGPT/fingpt-sentiment_internlm-20b_lora. In order to load these model in to google colab, the base model also needs to be loaded in. In practice, this can not be done without a high memory GPU which will allow for parrallel processing as these models are so large. Due ot this not being avaiable to us, the code bellow will set out how to go about train and fintuning a FinLLM, however will not run past the requirements and data loading section.\n",
        "\n",
        "I have used the fingpt-sentiment_internlm-20b_lora model in the example code as the base model, InternLM-20B, is freely accessible, where as the base model for FinGPT/fingpt-sentiment_llama2-13b_lora, Llama2-13B, requires approved access. In practice, running the below code should only give runtime errors.\n"
