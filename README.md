## Requirements

The requirments for each file are included in the individual notebooks. They were each built in colab so have the relevant requirments for running in colab.

## Description

Our analysis question for this project is: comparing different techniques to increase granularity of financial sentiment analysis. We will start by introducing the analysis domain and aim of the project and then implement and fine-tune the finBERT model as our baseline before running a variety of other models in contrast to finBERT. Finally we compare the models in the wrapup file and consider their scalability.
