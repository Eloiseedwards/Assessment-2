# Conclusion

* saying each model posed a solution to one of the drawbacks of finBERT - scale/ runtime; lack of topic sentiment; numerical reasoning
* how each model scales
* real-world applications - difficulty finding a large enough labelled dataset makes unsupervised techniques more appropriate
* for current dataset, distilBERT is best (smaller so works better on smaller dataset) - finBERT tended to overfit
